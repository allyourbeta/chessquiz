# ChessQuiz Roadmap

Living document. The single source of truth for "what's the state of this project and what should I work on next?"

**How to use this**: Read at the start of every session. Update at the end of every session. When in doubt about priority, refer here rather than re-deriving it.

## Up next (priority order)

### 1. Phase 17: Lichess Studies Import (~45 min)

Pull all of the user's Lichess studies (public AND private) via the Lichess API in one operation. Cleaner than depending on the LiChess Tools browser extension. Doubles as a learning step for Phase 13 (Lichess Bots), which uses the same auth pattern.

**Goal**: One-click "import all my Lichess studies" that downloads every study (public AND private) for a given Lichess username, saves them as a combined PGN file, then optionally imports them via the existing PGN flow. Each study chapter becomes a Game record. From there, the user can save individual positions as Puzzles or Tabiyas.

**Architecture:**

Backend:
- New endpoint: `POST /api/lichess/import-studies`
- Accepts: `{ "lichess_username": "...", "lichess_api_token": "..." }`
- Returns: SSE streaming progress (mirroring existing PGN import flow)
- Steps:
  1. Call `GET https://lichess.org/api/study/by/{username}` with `Authorization: Bearer {token}`
     - Response is NDJSON (one JSON object per line)
     - Parse and collect all study IDs
  2. For each study:
     - Call `GET https://lichess.org/api/study/{studyId}.pgn` with same auth
     - Append to combined PGN file
     - Add 1-second delay between calls (Lichess rate limit safety)
  3. Save combined PGN to temp location
  4. Return summary: `{ "studies_count": N, "chapters_count": M, "pgn_path": "..." }`

Frontend:
- New page under Games called "Import from Lichess"
- Form: Lichess username (text), Lichess API token (password input — never stored)
- Helper text linking to https://lichess.org/account/oauth/token explaining the `study:read` scope requirement
- SSE progress display reusing existing import progress UI components
- On completion: summary + button "Import as games" triggering existing PGN import flow

Token handling:
- Token is NEVER stored in the database
- User enters token each time (for now; can add encrypted token storage later if it becomes annoying)
- Show clear instructions for getting a token: visit https://lichess.org/account/oauth/token, create new token with `study:read` scope only

Error handling:
- 401 from Lichess → "Invalid token. Get a new one at..."
- 404 from Lichess → "Username not found"
- Network failure → retry once, then fail with clear error
- Single study failing should NOT stop batch — log, continue, include in summary as failed

Tests:
- Mock Lichess API responses
- Test: successful flow, bad token, network error, partial failure (one study fails out of three)
- Add to test_lichess_import.py

**Why first**: Without this, my Phase 15 puzzle UI is empty. My puzzle positions all live in Lichess studies. Manual download via the LiChess Tools extension turned out to be a maze.

**Required setup before running:**
- Get a Lichess API token at https://lichess.org/account/oauth/token
- Required scope: `study:read`
- Save token in a password manager — only shown once

### 2. Import Lichess studies content (~30 min after Phase 17 ships)

Use the new Lichess Studies import to pull StanFurd studies into ChessQuiz. Then manually walk through each tactical study chapter and save the critical position as a Puzzle.

This is content work — populating the puzzle UI with real data from my own curated studies (Tactics 1-4, Tactics missed, etc.).

After doing the manual save-as-puzzle for ~10 chapters, decide whether it feels tedious enough to warrant building auto-puzzle-extraction (where the chapter's first move = the solution).

### 3. Phase 13: Lichess Bots integration (~half day)

Variety of opponents at varied strengths. The thing I said I wanted most. Phase 17's Lichess API code provides the auth pattern this builds on.

- See: `SPEC-v2.md` Phase 13
- Lichess API token setup (already familiar after Phase 17)
- Bot discovery and challenge flow
- 200+ bots become potential practice opponents
- Practice History distinguishes bot opponents from local Stockfish

## Backlog (loosely ordered)

### Tier 2 — Substantive next steps

- **Phase 16B**: Test isolation enforcement (~1 hour) — permanent fix for the test pollution bug
- **Phase 14**: Generic engine pluggability + Maia (~half day) — local human-like opponents
- **Auto-puzzle-extraction from Lichess studies** (~1-2 hours) — if manual save-as-puzzle proves tedious, build a tool that walks each imported chapter and creates a Puzzle position with the first move as the solution

### Tier 3 — Build when actually needed

- **Phase 8**: Variation tree navigation — only matters once I'm studying annotated PGNs
- **Phase 11**: Repertoire builder + trainer — Chessable-like personal repertoire
- **Phase 12**: Auto-annotation + eval graph — analyze my own losses
- **Phase 16C**: Alembic for proper migrations
- **Phase 16D**: OPERATIONS.md runbook
- **Phase 16E**: Auto-backup hooks before risky operations

### Tier 4 — Polish

- PWA wrapper for mobile/desktop install
- Final UI design pass referencing Refactoring UI doc
- Position search UI cleanup
- Quiz tab UX polish

---

## Deferred / maybe never

- Multi-user / login / cloud sync — single-user app, not needed
- Server-side engine hosting — Lichess bots cover this need
- Mobile-native app — PWA is sufficient
- Lc0 with full networks — too large for browser, Maia covers human-like need
- Color-flipped position search — niche
- Cross-game move-order detection in import dedup — current Zobrist-on-position is already correct
- Encrypted token storage in DB — adds complexity, defer until manual token entry becomes annoying

## Friction log (real annoyances from actual use)

Add to this whenever something annoys you while using the app. These are the most reliable signal for what to fix next.

| What I tried | What happened | What I expected |
|--------------|---------------|-----------------|
|              |               |                 |
|              |               |                 |
|              |               |                 |

## Session-end ritual

Before closing a session, update this file:
1. Move completed items from "In progress" or "Up next" to "Recently shipped"
2. Update "Last updated" date
3. If you started something but didn't finish, leave it in "In progress" with a brief note
4. Add anything new that came up to "Up next" or "Backlog" as appropriate
5. Add any friction-log entries from real use
6. Commit: `git add ROADMAP.md && git commit -m "Update roadmap"`

---

## Session-start ritual

Open this file. Read "Up next." Pick one item. Don't second-guess the priority order — it was set at the end of the last session when context was fresh.
