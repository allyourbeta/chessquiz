# Chessdirbek

Personal chess position quiz app. Save positions (FEN), annotate them with notes and Stockfish analysis, tag them, and quiz yourself.

## Architecture

```
Vanilla JS (browser)
  ├── cm-chessboard v8 (board rendering, via CDN)
  ├── chess.js (move validation, client-side)
  └── calls → Python backend (FastAPI)
                ├── python-chess (FEN validation, pawn structure search)
                └── SQLite via SQLAlchemy (persistence)
```

## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Python 3 + FastAPI + SQLAlchemy + SQLite
- **Chess logic**: python-chess (backend), chess.js (frontend move validation)
- **Frontend**: Vanilla JS + cm-chessboard v8 (CDN) + chess.js (move validation)
- **Database**: SQLite (single file, no server)

## File Limits
- No file over 300 lines. Split immediately if exceeded.

## Backlog format (read by Tenzing)

`docs/backlog.yaml` is this project's record of work and is read by Tenzing.

- Items are entries under `items:` with `title`, `status` (`open` or `done`),
  optional `section` and `body`.
- When you ADD an item, omit `id`. Tenzing assigns one within the hour.
- When you EDIT an item, keep its `id` unchanged. Rewording is fine.
- When you COMPLETE an item, set `status: done`. Keep the entry.
- Never remove, reuse or renumber an `id`.
- Do not add priority, estimates or scheduling here. Those live in Tenzing.

## Build Stamp (automatic — do not hand-edit)
The build ID (`YYYYMMDD-HHMM`) is stamped into `frontend/js/build-stamp.js`
(`BUILD_ID`) and `backend/api/ocr.py` (`BACKEND_BUILD`) automatically by a
pre-commit hook at `scripts/hooks/pre-commit`. Do NOT bump these by hand.
One-time setup per clone: `git config core.hooksPath scripts/hooks`.
The frontend shows it as a small ⓘ marker in the header (full string on hover);
the backend echoes it at `/api/ocr/status`. If the two ever disagree, you're on
a stale cache — fix the cache, don't debug the logic.

## Backend Structure
- `models/` — SQLAlchemy models
- `api/` — FastAPI route handlers (all DB calls here)
  - `positions.py`, `positions_extra.py` — Position CRUD + bulk operations  
  - `practice.py`, `practice_stats.py` — Practice games + analytics
- `services/` — Pure functions for chess logic (no DB, no FastAPI imports)
- `main.py` — App entry point, mounts routers
- `database.py` — DB engine/session setup

## Key Decisions
- Single-user MVP (no auth). User ID hardcoded as 1.
- Quiz order: random within filtered tag set.
- Quiz history tracked from day one (for future spaced repetition).
- Engine: Stockfish WASM lives in `frontend/vendor/stockfish/`, wrapped by `engine.js` (see Troubleshooting → "Stockfish / Engine"). Play vs Engine + eval bar are active; analysis-tree nav is delegated to Lichess.
- python-chess used server-side for FEN validation, pawn structure, etc.

## Database Backup Scripts
Chessdirbek has automated backup scripts for data safety:

- `scripts/backup_database.sh` — Automated nightly backup at 3am via launchd. Uses SQLite's native backup API. Keeps the newest 10 backups (RETENTION_COUNT).
- `scripts/backup_now.sh` — Manual backup wrapper for use before risky operations. Creates backups with MANUAL prefix.
- `scripts/restore_database.sh <backup-filename>` — Interactive restore with confirmation prompt. Creates safety backup before restore.

Backups are stored in `backups/` directory (gitignored). The launchd plist is at `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.ashish.chessdirbek-backup.plist`.

To load/unload the automated backup:
- Load: `launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.ashish.chessdirbek-backup.plist`
- Unload: `launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.ashish.chessdirbek-backup.plist`

IMPORTANT: Always run `scripts/backup_now.sh` before any destructive operations, migrations, or bulk imports.

## Frontend Architecture Notes

The frontend is vanilla JS (no build tools). Scripts are loaded via `<script>`
tags in `index.html`. Two files use `<script type="module">`:

- `main.js` — ES module that imports cm-chessboard v8 from CDN. Defines
  `BoardManager` (window global). Also bootstraps the app by calling
  `Router.init()` at the end of its execution. This means all regular scripts
  must be loaded before `main.js`, and any global they define will be
  available when `Router.init()` triggers routing.
- `board-editor.js` — regular script (NOT a module). Must appear before
  `main.js` in `index.html` so `window.BoardEditor` exists when the router
  might navigate to the editor view.

Split files (to honor 300-line limit):
- `position-list.js` (list rendering) + `position-list-selection.js` (multi-select &
  bulk star/unstar) + `featured.js` — Position lists and featured board management
- `position-form.js` (form CRUD + board controls) + `position-form-puzzle.js`
  (prev/next puzzle navigation) — Add/edit position form
- `practice-ui.js` + `practice-ui-actions.js` — Practice session UI and inline actions
- `play.js` (game flow/state) + `play-view.js` (DOM rendering) + `play-result.js`
  (result rules + persistence) — Play vs Engine. NOTE: `play.js` is a cohesive stateful
  controller; the pure/loader pieces were extracted (to `fen-utils.js` and `play-result.js`)
  but the controller itself sits a little over 300 lines, as splitting it further would
  require threading its game state through another module.
- `piece-assets.js` (PIECE_SVG + pieceKey) + `ui-feedback.js` (toast/banner/notification)
  + `mini-board.js` (thumbnail renderer) — extracted from `shared.js`/`board.js` so each
  is one concern. All three are classic scripts loaded before `shared.js`; `mini-board.js`
  depends on `piece-assets.js`, so it must load after it.
- `fen-utils.js` — the single home for FEN reasoning (normalize, read/force side-to-move,
  sanitize/complete partial FENs, `loadChessFromBoardFen`). `play.js`, `board.js`, and
  `engine-games-ui.js` all call `FenUtils.*` instead of keeping their own copies. Pure
  module (attaches to `window.FenUtils`, also `module.exports` for Node tests). Load before
  its consumers. NOTE: `rotateFen180` lives in `fen-actions.js` (the clipboard/Lichess
  actions module), not here — it is not duplicated anywhere.

### cm-chessboard v8 API

The app uses cm-chessboard v8 via CDN. Key API facts for this version:

- `enableSquareSelect(handler)` — one argument (the callback). The handler
  receives an event with `event.square` (e.g. "e4"). Do NOT pass an event
  type as the first argument — that is a different version's API.
- `enableMoveInput(handler, color)` — used for drag-to-move on play boards.
- `setPosition(fen, animated)` — updates the board display.
- Exports: `Chessboard`, `COLOR`, `FEN`, `INPUT_EVENT_TYPE`. Do NOT try to
  import `POINTER_EVENTS` or `SQUARE_SELECT_TYPE` — they do not exist in the
  version served by `@8` on jsdelivr.

### Board Editor Interaction Model

The board editor uses click-to-place, NOT drag-and-drop:
1. Click a piece in the palette to select it as the active tool
2. Click a square on the board to place that piece
3. Click the eraser tool, then click a square to remove a piece

## Troubleshooting

### Stockfish / Engine — PRESENT (rebuilt)

The old engine integration (`engine-ui.js`, `stockfish-service.js`,
`practice-engine-service.js`) was removed on 2026-05-27 because it had
accumulated irreconcilable state bugs across 12+ competing state variables.
It was since rebuilt around a single, stateless wrapper, which is what the app
uses today.

Current engine layout:
- `frontend/vendor/stockfish/stockfish-18-lite-single.js` + `.wasm` — the engine (present).
- `frontend/js/engine.js` — the only engine wrapper. Stateless "oracle behind a
  Promise wall": `Engine.bestMove(fen, {elo, movetimeMs})`, `Engine.evaluate(fen,
  {depth})`, `Engine.stop()`. Hardened against three hazards: a per-search
  **timeout** (no more infinite "Engine thinking" hangs), **init retry** after a
  failed boot, and a **stop-race drain** (a stale `bestmove` from a stopped
  search can't resolve a newer request). Timeouts are overridable via
  `Engine._test.setTimeouts(...)` for tests.
- `frontend/js/eval-bar.js` — evaluation display, driven by `Engine.evaluate`.
- `frontend/js/play.js` + `play-view.js` — Play vs Engine (logic / presentation split).
- `frontend/js/game-replay.js` — replay with per-move eval.

Analysis-tree navigation was deliberately NOT rebuilt; "Analyze on Lichess"
buttons (see `engine-games-ui.js`) hand the position off to Lichess instead.

What works: Play vs Engine at selectable Elo; a finished game shows a sticky
panel (Play again / Back to position / Analyze) rather than auto-navigating;
"End game" lets you stop early and mark the result (Win/Loss/Draw/Unfinished).

### Board editor not working

The board editor has two known failure modes:

1. **`BoardEditor` is undefined** — `board-editor.js` must be loaded as a
   regular `<script>` (NOT `type="module"`) and must appear BEFORE `main.js`
   in `index.html`. If it's a module or appears after `main.js`, the router
   will try to call `BoardEditor.init()` before it exists.
2. **Clicking squares does nothing** — the `BoardManager.enableSquareSelect()`
   method must use cm-chessboard's native one-argument API. If someone changes
   it to pass `POINTER_EVENTS.pointerdown` as the first argument, square
   selection will silently fail.
# Stabilization Guardrails

Before editing:

1. Run `./test_smoke.sh`
2. Do not proceed if tests fail.

After editing:

1. Run `./test_smoke.sh`
2. Do not declare completion unless it passes.

## Hard Rules

Do not introduce:

* inline HTML event handlers
* direct frontend `fetch()` outside `frontend/js/api-client.js`
* direct `history.back()` outside `frontend/js/navigation.js`
* undocumented `innerHTML`
* direct FEN clipboard writes outside `frontend/js/fen-actions.js`
* duplicated naming, ECO, move-count, notification, FEN, save-current-position, or category-label logic

Use existing centralized helpers/services:

* ApiClient
* Navigation
* NamingService
* BoardManager.getCurrentFen()
* MoveCounts
* EcoOpenings
* PositionTypes
* FenActions
* Notifications
* SaveCurrentPosition
* EmptyStates

This is a vanilla-JS app.
Do not introduce React, TypeScript migrations, bundlers, or framework rewrites.

If adding new functionality:

* prefer extending existing helpers/services
* avoid creating parallel ownership paths
* preserve stabilization invariants
